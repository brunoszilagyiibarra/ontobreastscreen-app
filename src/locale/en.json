It allows healthcare professionals to estimate a woman's risk of developing invasive breast cancer over the next five years and up to age 90 (lifetime risk). The tool uses a woman's personal medical and reproductive history and the history of breast cancer among her first-degree relatives (mother, sisters, daughters) to estimate the absolute risk of breast cancer: her chance or probability of developing breast cancer. invasive breast in a defined age range.\nLimitations of the tool: This tool cannot accurately estimate the risk of breast cancer for: <ul><li>Women who carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that causes breast cancer</li><li>Women with a history of invasive or in situ breast cancer (lobular carcinoma in situ or ductal carcinoma in situ)</li><li>Women in certain other subgroups</li></ul>",
